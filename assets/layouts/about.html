    <h5>Asking the "RIGHT" questions</h5>
    <p>Are you in need of a business solution that will:
        <ul> 
            <li>reduce man-hours</li>
            <li>remove the grind of repetitive tasks</li>
            <li>easily duplicate results</li>
            <li>take the complexity out of that process</li>
            <li>eliminate the human element of data manipulation</li>
        </ul>
        <span>Congratulations!</span> Your search is at an end.
    </p>
    <h5>VLOOKUP is for beginners</h5>
    <p>Thousands of records, multiple commissions rules, a year's worth of data in review led myself to keep asking 
        <br><span>"Self, how can we do this better?"</span>
        <br>I scoured Google and YouTube to find the answers and got bit by the programming bug. 
        <br>What?! No, not THAT bug. It was the intense burning desire for learning more. 
        <br>I took that analysis from several days to a few hours, and with the help of a business analyst, also took my first steps into SQL.
    </p>
    <h5>It took you HOW LONG?</h5>
    <p>When a colleague said it took three days a month to compile data, balance accounting, and report results I almost cried. 
        <br>I can help!. Let me help. I'm certain I can shave a few hours at least off that.
        <br>Not only did I cut hours, I cut days. From start to finish compiling data, identify the balancing issues, and generate those results consistently now took 2-3 hours.
    </p>
    <h5>Integrating Data Integrity</h5>
    <p>You're telling me we have four workbooks to enter information. Why?!?
        <br>I constructed a user form to enter the information <strong>once</strong>. I eliminated the need for adjustments in the commissions department and drastically reduced the number of hours it took to audit those commission records.
        <br>The data was parsed and saved to the various workbooks, performed complex calculations, and automatically send commissions paperwork to payroll for processing.

    <h4>Passion & Motivation</h4>
    <p>Now, you <i>should</i> have a better idea of the <span>what</span> and the <span>how</span>. Time for the <span>why</span>.
