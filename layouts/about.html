            <h5>VLOOKUP is for beginners</h5>
            <p>Thousands of records, multiple commissions rules, a year's worth of data in review led myself to keep asking 
                <br><span>"Self, how can we do this better?"</span>
                <br>I scoured Google and YouTube to find the answers and got bit by the programming bug. 
                <br>What?! No, not THAT bug. It was the intense burning desire for learning more. 
                <br>I took that analysis from several days to a few hours, and with the help of a business analyst, also took my first steps into SQL.

                <h5>It took you HOW LONG?</h5>
                <p>When a colleague said it took three days a month to compile data, balance accounting, and report results I almost cried. 
                    <br>I can help!. Let me help. I'm certain I can shave a few hours at least off that.
                    <br>Not only did I cut hours, I cut days. From start to finish compiling data, identify the balancing issues, and generate those results consistently now took 2-3 hours.

                <h5>Integrating Data Integrity</h5>
                <p>You're telling me we have four workbooks to enter information. Why?!?
                    <br>I constructed a user form to enter the information <strong>once</strong>. I eliminated the need for adjustments in the commissions department and drastically reduced the number of hours it took to audit those commission records.
                    <br>The data was parsed and saved to the various workbooks, performed complex calculations, and automatically send commissions paperwork to payroll for processing.
